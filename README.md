Design Goals:

    -   Discord Embeds

    -   Steam Rich-Presence

    -   Support for adding items to price-list using their classifieds links.

    -   And many more.

 

Embed Demonstration;

This is what currently shows when you do the !listing command in discord with
the new tf2autobot-neko bots

 

Steam Rich Presence;

Here we say a tf2autobot-neko playing tf2 with a custom rich-presence saying it
is in special event Autopatting neko



Last but not least,

Autobump;

With tf2autobot-neko your bots can autobump without using backpack.tf premium!
