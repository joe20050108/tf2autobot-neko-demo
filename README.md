====================

Design Goals:

-   Discord Embeds

-   Steam Rich-Presence

-   Support for adding items to price-list using their classifieds links.

-   And many more.


```diff
+ All tf2autobot-neko bot instances are handled in [PM2] (https://pm2.keymetrics.io) 
```

PM2 commands;

Hosting bots couldnt be more easier with the ability to stop start and restart a specific PM2 instance!

 

Embed Demonstration;

This is what currently shows when you do the !listing command in discord with
the new tf2autobot-neko bots

 

Steam Rich Presence;

Here we say a tf2autobot-neko playing tf2 with a custom rich-presence saying it
is in special event Autopatting neko



Last but not least,

Autobump;
