====================

Design Goals:

-   Discord Embeds

-   Steam Rich-Presence

-   Support for adding items to price-list using their classifieds links.

-   And many more.


```diff
+ All tf2autobot-neko bot instances are handled in PM2
+ ONLY tf2autobot-neko proccesses can communicate with each other through PM2. TF2ABN-L and TF2ABN are unable to utilize this feature. (PM2BUS)
```

PM2 commands;

Hosting bots couldnt be more easier with the ability to stop start and restart a specific [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io)  instance!

Interprocess Communication using a custom PM2 API.

This is what currently shows when you do the !listing command in discord with
the new tf2autobot-neko bots

 

Steam Rich Presence;

Here we say a tf2autobot-neko playing tf2 with a custom rich-presence saying it
is in special event Autopatting neko



Last but not least,

Autobump;

With tf2autobot-neko your bots can autobump without using backpack.tf premium! 
###### (At minimum you need to wait at least 4 hours)

Links;

Links now have a nicer looking embed for discord. This image shows the difference between the two.

Embed Accent Indicators;

Embeds have certain colors like red for error yellow for warning and green for OK and pink for normal embeds. 
###### These colors can be changed in options.json!
